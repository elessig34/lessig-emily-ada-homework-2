## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Challenge 1

Load dataset as a tibble 
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(kableExtra)
library(mosaic)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
install.packages("ggpubr")
library(ggpubr)
library(radiant)
library(cowplot)

f <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2021-datasets/master/IMDB-movies.csv'

d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
```
Use a one-line statement to filter the dataset to include just movies from 1920 to 1979 and movies that are between 1 and 3 hours longs and add a new column that codes the startYear into a new variable, decade ("20s,"30s"...) -->5651 movies
```{r}

d <- filter(d, runtimeMinutes >= 60 & runtimeMinutes <=180 & startYear %in% 1920:1979) %>%
  mutate(decade=case_when(
    startYear %in% 1920:1929 ~"20s",
    startYear %in% 1930:1939 ~"30s",
    startYear %in% 1940:1949 ~"40s",
    startYear %in% 1950:1959 ~"50s",
    startYear %in% 1960:1969 ~"60s",
    startYear %in% 1970:1979 ~"70s",
    
  ))

#yes, d is 5651
```

Use ggplot2 to plot histograms of the distribution of runtimeMinutes for each decade

```{r}

d %>% ggplot(aes(x=runtimeMinutes))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~decade)

```

Use a one-line statement to calculate the population mean and population standard deviation in runtimeMinutes for each decade and save the results in a new dataframe, results

```{r}

results <- d %>% group_by(decade) %>%
   summarise(mean=mean(runtimeMinutes), sd=sd(runtimeMinutes))

results
```

Draw a single sample of 100 movies, without replacement, from each decade, calculate this single sample mean and sample std in runtimeMinutes and estimes the SE around the population mean runtimeMinutes for each decade based on the std and sample size from these samples

```{r}
s <- d %>% group_by(decade) %>% sample_n(100) 
g <-s %>% group_by(decade) %>% summarise(means=mean(runtimeMinutes), std=sd(runtimeMinutes))

pop_mean <- results$mean
pop_sd <- results$sd
pop_se <- pop_sd/sqrt(n)



```


('20s' <- summarize(.data = `20s_sampMean`, mean = mean(`20s_sampMean`$mean), sd = sd(`20s_sampMean`$mean)))
hist(`20s_sampMean`$mean)                                                           
                                                              
('30s' <- summarize(.data = `30s_sampMean`, mean = mean(`30s_sampMean`$mean), sd = sd(`30s_sampMean`$mean)))
hist(`30s_sampMean`$mean)    

('40s' <- summarize(.data = `40s_sampMean`, mean = mean(`40s_sampMean`$mean), sd = sd(`40s_sampMean`$mean)))
hist(`40s_sampMean`$mean)  

('50s' <- summarize(.data = `50s_sampMean`, mean = mean(`50s_sampMean`$mean), sd = sd(`50s_sampMean`$mean)))
hist(`50s_sampMean`$mean)  

('60s' <- summarize(.data = `60s_sampMean`, mean = mean(`60s_sampMean`$mean), sd = sd(`60s_sampMean`$mean)))
hist(`60s_sampMean`$mean)  

('70s' <- summarize(.data = `70s_sampMean`, mean = mean(`70s_sampMean`$mean), sd = sd(`70s_sampMean`$mean)))
hist(`70s_sampMean`$mean)  

#histograms look normal 

SE = c(`20s`$sd,`30s`$sd,`40s`$sd,`50s`$sd,`60s`$sd,`70s`$sd)



```
Challenge 2



```{r}

ppois(9, lambda=12)

ppois(0, lambda = 12)

dpois(5, lambda = 12)

1- ppois(18, lambda = 12)

```

Plot the relevant Poisson mass function 

```{r}

x= 0:24
y=dpois(x,lambda = 12)
barplot(y,
        ylim=c(0, 0.3),
        names.arg = x,
        space = 0.2
        )


```

Use rpois function, simulate 1460 results from distribution 

```{r}

r <- rpois(1460, 12)

hist(r, xlim = c(0, 24))

```

Challenge 3

```{r}
d <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2021-datasets/master/zombies.csv")

#calculate means & SD

zombies <- select(d, "gender", "height", "weight", "age", "years_of_education", "zombies_killed")

means <- summarise(zombies, mean(height), mean(weight), mean(age), mean(year_of_education), mean(zombies_killed)

SD <- summarise(zombies, sd(height), sd(weight), sd(age),  sd(years_of_education), sd(zombies_killed))


```

boxplots

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x=factor(0), y=height))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~gender) +theme_classic()

ggplot(d, aes(x=factor(0), y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~gender) +theme_classic()

ggplot(d, aes(x=factor(0), y=age))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~gender) +theme_classic()

ggplot(d, aes(x=factor(0), y=years_of_education))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~gender) +theme_classic()

ggplot(d, aes(x=factor(0), y=zombies_killed))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(~gender) +theme_classic()

```

scatterplots 


```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x=age, y=weight))+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender)) + theme_classic()

ggplot(d, aes(x=age, y=height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=gender)) +theme_classic()

##There seems to be a positive relationship between age and height with male heights being higher than females. Similarly, males seem to have a higher average weight than females (across ages), but there does not appear to be a disernable relationship otherwise between weight and age.
```
QQ plot 

```{r}
qqnorm(d$height)


hist(d$height)

#seems to have a normal distribution 

qqnorm(d$weight)
hist(d$weight) #seems normal

qqnorm(d$age)
hist(d$age) #seems normal

qqnorm(d$years_of_education)
hist(d$years_of_education) #does not look normal (binomial?)

qqnorm(d$zombies_killed)
hist(d$zombies_killed) # does not look normal (binomial?)

```

```{r}


n <- 50

q <- sample_n (zombies, size=n, replace=FALSE)


(mean_samp <- apply(q, 2, mean))
(sd_samp <- apply(q, 2, sd))
(se_samp <- sd_samp/sqrt(n))
```
Draw another 99 random samples...
```{r}

random <- data.frame()
for (i in 1:99) {
  sample <- d %>% sample_n(50) %>% summarise(height_mean = mean(height), 
                weight_mean = mean(weight), 
                age_mean = mean(age), 
                kills_mean = mean(zombies_killed), 
                ed_mean = mean(years_of_education),
                height_se = sd(height), 
                weight_se = sd(weight),
                age_se = sd(age),
                kills_se = sd(zombies_killed),
                edu_se = sd(years_of_education))
dist <- rbind(dist, sample)
}

summ <- dist%>% summarise(height_mean= mean(m_height), 
               weight_mean = mean(m_weight), 
                age_mean= mean(m_age), 
               kills_mean = mean(m_kills), 
               ed_mean = mean(m_edu),
                height_se = sd(se_height), 
                weight_se = sd(se_weight),
               age_se  = sd(se_age),
                kills_se = sd(se_kills),
               edu_se= sd(se_edu))
```
```{r}

for (i in seq(1, 10, 2)) {
CIi<- dist[[1,i]] + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(1 - .05 / 2) * dist_stats[[1, i+1]]
print(paste("95% CI", colnames(dist_stats)[i], ": ", sep=""))
print(CI)
